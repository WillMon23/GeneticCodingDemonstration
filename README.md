## How to Play

The idea is to use cubes to demonstrate mendel's law of inheritance.

Cubes spawn in front of the player, each with there own stats for Size and Color.

Though these cubes are displaying a diffrent size and color they themselves con recreate diffrent cubes based of there allies.

By setting the parents using the left and right mouse click (Left for Mother and Right for Father Parent).

The idea is that it dose not matter who the parents are.

Mother and Father can Be any of the three Cubes on the pedestal.

Once chosen click the red button near the middles with any mouse click

- Note: There is no way to display whether a parent is chosen (Just Trust me It Was Chosen If Clicked)

- Note 2: The Box by the middle pedestal can't inherit any stats it's noly there eto demonstrate the ability to also use with Blueprints
